## Installing Prism Launcher
<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
  From your terminal, enter: `winget install prismlauncher` or `winget install prismlauncher.prismlauncher`. 
  Otherwise get it from the [official source](https://prismlauncher.org/download/windows/).

  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
  It's on Flathub.
  If you hate yourself, you can also get the [.appimage](https://prismlauncher.org/download/). This will not work on the [greatest invention known to mankind.](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck).

    *Did you really think that I was going to hold your hand for this? You're on Linux.*

# Installing the modpack
1. Download the file through [this link](https://wiki.spherico.one/modpack/sphericomc-4.zip).
2. In Prism Launcher, **create** a new instance, go to **import** and **select** the file you have downloaded.
3. Launch the instance **at least once** and let it load to the main menu.

## Updating the modpack
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Version 4.2.0 and above">
    From version 4.2.0 onwards, the modpack will automatically update itself upon launching the game.
    There are no further actions required. 
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Version 4.1.0 and below">
    Modpack versions under 4.1.3 have a different setup that prevent them from being updated automatically.
    Affected players must create a new instance and follow the **Installing the modpack** section.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

It is important to note that certain versions of SphericoMC may reset your keybinds or settings to the default values.
In order to carry over your configurations, [follow this guide](/minecraft/s4/config_migration).

# Connect to the server
The server should be conveniently be in your multiplayer menu already!
Otherwise just enter `mc.spherico.one` in the new server window.

<Aside type="danger" icon="error" title="Whitelist">
Make sure you have given your Minecraft username to an administrator, otherwise the whitelist will prevent you from joining the server.
