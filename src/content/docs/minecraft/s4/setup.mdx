# Prerequisites
We assume, from this point onwards, that you are aware that you are going to be playing modded Minecraft.
You will need to have Java installed.
**Prism Launcher is the only officially supported launcher.** 

## Installing Prism Launcher
<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
  From your terminal, enter: `winget install prismlauncher` or `winget install prismlauncher.prismlauncher`. 
  Otherwise get it from the [official source](https://prismlauncher.org/download/windows/).
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
  Get it from the [offical source](https://prismlauncher.org/download/mac/). 
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
  It's on Flathub.
  If you hate yourself, you can also get the [.appimage](https://prismlauncher.org/download/). This will not work on the [greatest invention known to mankind.](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck).

    *Did you really think that I was going to hold your hand for this? You're on Linux.*

# Installing the modpack
1. Download the file through [this link]().
2. In Prism Launcher, **create** a new instance, **import** a custom modpack and **select** the file you have downloaded.

<Aside type="note" icon="seti:config" title="Keeping your configuration">
If you want to migrate your configuration, [follow this guide](/minecraft/s4/config_migration).
</Aside>

## Updating the modpack
Starting with version 4.2.0, the modpack will automatically update itself upon launching the game.

<Aside type="danger" icon="error" title="Configuration">
Certain versions of Spherico-MC may reset your keybinds or settings to factory settings. 
In order to carry over your configurations, [follow this guide](/minecraft/s4/config_migration).
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Legacy modpack versions (< 4.1.3)">
  Older modpack versions contain breaking changes that prevent them from being updated to newer versions.
  Affected players must create a new instance and follow the **Installing the modpack** section.
</Aside>

# Connect to the server
The server should be conveniently be in your multiplayer menu already! 
Otherwise just enter `mc.spherico.one` in the new server window. 

<Aside type="danger" icon="error" title="Whitelist">
Make sure you have given your Minecraft username to an administrator, otherwise the whitelist will prevent you from joining the server.
