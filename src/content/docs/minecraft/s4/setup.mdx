# Prerequisites
We assume, from this point onwards, that you are aware that you are going to be playing modded Minecraft. You will need to have Java isntalled. 
You can use the default Minecraft launcher, but Prism launcher is so, so, so much better. 

## Installing Prism Launcher
<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
  From your terminal, enter: `winget install prismlauncher` or `winget install prismlauncher.prismlauncher`. 
  Otherwise get it from the [official source](https://prismlauncher.org/download/windows/).
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
  Get it from the [offical source](https://prismlauncher.org/download/mac/). 
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
  It's on Flathub.
  If you hate yourself, you can also get the [.appimage](https://prismlauncher.org/download/). This will not work on the [greatest invention known to mankind.](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck).

    *Did you really think that I was going to hold your hand for this? You're on Linux.*
