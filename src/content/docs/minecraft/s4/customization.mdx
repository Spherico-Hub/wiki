## Resource Packs
This is still Minecraft. 

You can install [Faithful 32x](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithful-32x) if 16 pixels isn't enough for your fancy tastes.
Several addons exist for it too, they can be found [here](https://faithfulpack.net/addons).

Since version 4.3.1, the modpack supports advanced resource packs such as [Fresh Animations](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fresh-animations).
If you are to add it, pairing it with its [extenstions](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fresh-animations-extensions) and [compatibility pack to Vanilla Backport](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/vanilla-backport-x-fresh-animations) is highly recommended.

## Shaders
You'll need Iris in order for Shaders to work, which is already provided in the modpack.

Here are a few you can use: 
- For beefy rigs: [Rethinking Voxels](https://modrinth.com/shader/rethinking-voxels)
- Complimentary - [Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) or [Unbound](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound)
- [Photon Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/photon-shader) 
    - *(There are currently a few bugs but hey, [FAFO](http://fafo.urbanup.com/17618639).)*
- [BSL Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/bsl-shaders)
