## Resource Packs
This is still Minecraft. 

You can install [Faithful 32x](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithful-32x) if 16 pixels isn't enough for your fancy tastes.
Several addons exist for it too, they can be found [here](https://faithfulpack.net/addons).

## Shaders
You'll need Iris in order for Shaders to work, which is already provided in the modpack.

Here are a few you can use: 
- For beefy rigs: [Rethinking Voxels](https://modrinth.com/shader/rethinking-voxels)
- [Photon Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/photon-shader) 
    - *(There are currently a few bugs but hey, [FAFO](http://fafo.urbanup.com/17618639).)*
- [BSL Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/bsl-shaders)
